## What are the statistics?
So what drove Cruise, Waymo, Zoox, and other auto industries to integrate self-driving capabilities in a vehicle? The answer is simple: To make driving safe for everyone; reduce the number of car accidents and traffic time; and reduce carbon emissions. Here are the statistics:

## Battery technology
To make electric vehicles (EV) be in competition with combusition-based vehicles, an EV will need an energy storage that can provide fast charge time, high cycle life, safety, and a high operating temperature. While liquid lithium batteries have been the baseline for powering most devices, researchers have developed a better solution to address the issues above: solid-state batteries. I curated a list of articles that explain solid-state batteries, how lithium ion batteries are simulated and model, and the standards for testing lithium-ion batteries.
### Solid-state batteries

## UI/UX Design
While sensors, battery technology, and AI have made vehicles achieve self-driving, another component that shouldn't be overlooked is the UX/UI design. While the technology is there, the vehicle must be able to convey to the passenger that it can be trusted. During the development, it is important that developers have a user-centered design approach - an iterative design process where designers focus on the users and their needs in each phase of the design process. Below is a list of articles and books that emphasize the UI/UX design in the auto industry.
