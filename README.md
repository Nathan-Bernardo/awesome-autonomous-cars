## Battery technology
To make electric vehicles (EV) be in competition with combusition-based vehicles, an EV will need an energy storage that can provide fast charge time, high cycle life, safety, and a high operating temperature. While liquid lithium batteries have been the baseline for powering most devices, researchers have developed a better solution to address the issues above: solid-state batteries. I curated a list of articles that explain solid-state batteries, how lithium ion batteries are simulated and model, and the standards for testing lithium-ion batteries.
